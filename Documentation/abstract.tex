		Imitation of the operation of a real-world processes or system over time is very often used by almost all engineers. Those imitation is called simulation and is used because some processes cannot be engaged because some of them are not accessible or it may be dangerous or unacceptable to engage, sometimes this processes doesn't exist at all. Numerical methods can be really useful and powerful tools for solving differential equations specified by those processes. This report summarizes and explains work about four common numerical schemes: explicit upwind, implicit upwind, Lax-Wendroff and Richtmyer multi-step to solve a simple linear advection equation. For each of schemes calculation were made for different delta time, time levels and grid sizes. All of schemes and other necessary code were written in pure C++ language.
		
		Linear advection equation is an example of partial differential equation for time and space. Applying schemes for different set of parameters showed that every numerical solution have to struggle with errors and undesirable effects, such as: dissipation, dispersion and instability. Accumulation of the error and overall loss of accuracy were due to increase of time steps.  Outlined how accurate schemes are and how do the numerical solutions vary with the CFL number(Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy) and how increase of the grid size examine the grid convergence, which for all of the schemes has been shown that they are converged.
		
		%IS IT TRUE?
		In the last sections comparison between schemes were made. All of the schemes have unique properties that were compared to the expected properties based on the knowledge in the literature. Schema with the biggest tolerance of CFL number is implicit upwind because it is stable for a wide range of values. Other schemes have more restricted criteria of stability, which makes them very vulnerable of losing control of an increase in error. Richtmyer multi-step and Lax-Wendroff schemes are comparable and have the highest accuracy due to applying correct with each time step.
